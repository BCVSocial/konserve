# konserve

A key-value store protocol implemented with [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) to allow Clojuresque collection operations on associative key-value stores, both from Clojure and ClojureScript for different backends. Data is generally serialized with [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) semantics or, if supported, as native binary blobs and can be accessed similar to `clojure.core` functions `get-in`,`assoc-in` and `update-in`. Each operation is run atomically and must be consistent (in fact ACID), but further consistency is not supported (Riak, CouchDB and many scalable solutions don't have transactions over keys for that reason). This is meant to be a building block for more sophisticated storage solutions (Datomic also builds on kv-stores), it is not necessarily fast depending on the usage pattern. The general idea is to write most values once (e.g. in form of index fragments) and only update one place once all data is written, similar to Clojure's persistent datastructures.

## Supported Backends

The protocol is implemented at the moment for CouchDB with [clutch](https://github.com/clojure-clutch/clutch), an experimental file-system store in Clojure and for [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB) in ClojureScript. The file-system store currently uses [fressian](https://github.com/clojure/data.fressian) and is quite efficient. For CouchDB and IndexedDB there is no internal JSON-representation of the underlying store like [transit](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-clj) yet, hence they are fairly slow.  New storage backends, e.g. Riak, MongoDB, Redis, JDBC, WebSQL, Local-Storage are welcome. This was initially implemented as a storage protocol for [geschichte](https://github.com/ghubber/geschichte).

There is a JSON store protocol implemented for IndexedDB in case interoperability with a JavaScript application is wanted. Be careful not to collide values with edn, use different stores if reasonable.

## Usage

Add to your leiningen dependencies:

~~~clojure
[net.polyc0l0r/konserve "0.2.2"]
~~~

For simple purposes a memory store is implemented as well:
~~~clojure
(ns test-db
  (:require [konserve.store :refer [new-mem-store]]))

(go (def my-db (<! (new-mem-store)))) ;; or
(go (def my-db (<! (new-mem-store (atom {:foo 42})))))
~~~

In ClojureScript from a browser (you need IndexedDB available in your js env):
~~~clojure
(ns test-db
  (:require [konserve.indexeddb :refer [new-indexeddb-store]])
  (:require-macros [cljs.core.async.macros :refer [go go-loop]]))

(go (def my-db (<! (new-indexeddb-store "konserve"))))

(go (println "get:" (<! (-get-in my-db ["test" :a]))))

(go (doseq [i (range 10)]
       (<! (-assoc-in my-db [i] i))))

;; prints 0 to 9 each on a line
(go (doseq [i (range 10)]
      (println (<! (-get-in my-db [i])))))

(go (println (<! (-assoc-in my-db ["test"] {:a 1 :b 4.2}))))

(go (println (<! (-update-in my-db ["test" :a] inc))))
;; => "test" contains {:a 2 :b 4.2}
~~~

In Clojure analogous from a Clojure REPL with CouchDB run:
~~~clojure
(ns test-db
    (:require [konserve.filestore :refer [new-fs-store]]
              [clojure.core.async :as async :refer [<!!]]))

(def store (<!! (new-fs-store "/tmp/store" (atom {}))))

(<!! (-assoc-in store ["foo" :bar] {:foo "baz"}))
(<!! (-get-in store ["foo"]))
(<!! (-exists? store "foo"))

(<!! (-assoc-in store [:bar] 42))
(<!! (-update-in store [:bar] inc))
(<!! (-get-in store [:bar]))

(let [ba (byte-array (* 10 1024 1024) (byte 42))]
  (time (<!! (-bassoc store "banana" ba))))
(<!! (-bget store "banana" :input-stream))
~~~

## Tagged Literals

You can read and write custom records with edn, but you have to supply the proper reader-functions through a store-wide tag-table atom, in the format of `{'namespace.Symbol (fn [val] ...realize proper object...)}` (this might differ depending on the backend atm.), which can be bound to a runtime wide atom in case you don't have different data schemas and code-versions to deal with. You can omit it, if you don't use tagged literals in your edn.

## TODO
- depend on hasch and use uuid hash as key/filename for file-store (and others)
- implement generic cached store(s) to wrap durable ones
- allow to iterate keys (model a cursor?)
- move repl examples to tests
- calculate patches and store base-value and edn patches, to allow fast small nested updates

## Changelog

### 0.2.3
- filestore: fsync on fs operations
- couchdb: add -exists?
- remove logging and return ex-info exceptions in go channel

### 0.2.2
- filestore: locking around java strings is a bad idea, use proper lock objects
- filestore: do io inside async/thread (like async's pipeline) to not block the async threadpool
- filestore: implement a naive cache (flushes once > 1000 values)
- filestore, indexeddb: allow to safely custom deserialize file-inputstream in transaction/lock
- filestore, indexeddb, memstore: implement -exists?

### 0.2.1
- filestore: fix fressian collection types for clojure, expose read-handlers/write-handlers
- filestore: fix -update-in behaviour for nested values
- filestore: fix rollback renaming order

### 0.2.0
- experimental native ACID file-store for Clojure
- native binary blob support for file-store, IndexedDB and mem-store
